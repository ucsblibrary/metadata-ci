Given a G-Galois K-algebra Kh, let Ah be the fractional ideal in Kh whose square is the inverse different of Kh/K, which exists by Hilbert&apos;s formula since G has odd order. By a theorem of B. Erez, we know that Ah is locally free over OKG when Kh/K is weakly ramified, i.e. all of the second ramification groups in lower numbering attached to K h/K are trivial. In this case, the module Ah determines a class cl(Ah) in the locally free class group Cl(OKG) of OKG. Such a class in Cl( OKG) will be called A-realizable, and tame A-realizable if Kh/K is in fact tame. We will write A( OKG) and A t(OKG) for the sets of all A-realizable classes and tame A-realizable classes in Cl(OKG), respectively.",,,,Title from finding aid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300046300,http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300127104,,,,,,,,,,,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm001394,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm005944,,,,,,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81028945 ,,,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/img,,reformatted digital,"[Item description].

First of all, we will show that At( OKG) is in fact a subgroup of Cl( OKG) and that a class cl( Ah) &in; A(O KG) is tame A-realizable if the wildly ramified primes of Kh/K satisfy suitable assumptions. Our result will imply that A(O KG) = At( OKG) holds if the primes dividing &mid; G&mid; are totally split in K/Q. Then, we will show that &Psi;(A(O KG)) = &Psi;At( OKG)) holds without any extra assumptions. Here &Psi; is the natural homomorphism Cl(O KG) &rarr; Cl(M(KG)) afforded by extension of scalars and Cl(M( KG)) denotes the locally free class group of the maximal OK-order M( KG) in KG.

The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, inspired by works in [DWW05], [GHP03], and [Wan91], by using a Bochner type argument, we prove that complete Riemannian manifolds with non-zero imaginary Killing spinors are stable, and provide a stability condition for Riemannian manifolds with non-zero real Killing spinors in terms of a twisted Dirac operator. Regular Sasaki-Einstein manifolds are essentially principal circle bundles over K&#xE4;hler-Einstein manifolds. We prove that if the base space of a regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold is a product of at least two K&#xE4;hler-Einstein manifolds, then the regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold is unstable. More generally, we show that Einstein metrics on principal torus bundles constructed in [WZ90] are unstable, if the base spaces are products of at least two K&#xE4;hler-Einstein manifolds.",,,,Title supplied by library staff.,,Date inferred from code on item.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300046300,http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300127104,,,,,,,,,,,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm001394,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm005944,,,,,,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81028945 ,,,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes/img,,reformatted digital,"[Item description].
